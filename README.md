I created a lifestyle blog where users can:

1. Create an account
2. Write articles with image headers
3. Vote on different articles. Both of the same user or a different user.
4. Add articles to different categories
5. Create new categories


- I created a has_many belongs_to relationship between users and articles
- I also created relationships between articles and their categories
- To create votes, I created a join relationship. So votes belong to users and articles.
- I set up the layout of the app, using the given design.
- I laid out the basic MVP. Focusing on getting the app to work first.
